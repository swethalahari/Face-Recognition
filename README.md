# Face-Recognition

Face recognition deals with Computer Vision a discipline of Artificial Intelligence and uses techniques of image processing and deep learning
Face recognition deals with identification to establish whose face it is by matching it to an existing face database

# About the Project

In this hands-on project, the goal is to build a face recognition system, which includes building a face detector to locate the position of a face in an image
and a face identification model to recognize whose face it is by matching it to the existing database of faces.

For this we use CNN and SVM Classifier to recognise if the image belongs to a specific person or not.
